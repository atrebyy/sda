### **Lecture 5: Architecture Representation and Views**  
*How we represent software architecture, the various types of architectural views, and their importance in addressing different concerns of stakeholders. Explore the tools and techniques used for documenting architecture effectively.*

### **1. What Are Architecture Views?**  
**Definition:**  
Architecture views are **formal models** of a software system. They document the architecture and focus on specific concerns from particular perspectives.  

#### **Key Characteristics:**
1. Each view omits entities irrelevant to its specific perspective.  
2. The **entities** in a view are described in terms of **components** (building blocks) and **connectors** (relationships).  

**Example:**  
An execution view might focus on runtime interactions between processes, while an allocation view could show how modules are assigned to teams or hardware.

**Interactive Pause:** Why do you think documenting different views is essential for stakeholders?

### **2. The Three Basic Views**  
The software industry has settled on **three primary architectural views**, though many more can be considered:  

#### **A. Conceptual View (Structural View):**  
- Focuses on domain-level functionality and relationships.  
- **Components:** Modules, classes, or packages.  
- **Connectors:** Relationships like inheritance or dependency.  
- **Key Questions Answered:**  
  - What responsibilities are assigned to each module?  
  - What are the relationships between modules?  
  - How is the system structured in terms of code units?  

**Example:**  
In a class-based structure:  
- Modules = classes.  
- Connectors = "inherits-from" or "uses" relationships.  

---

#### **B. Execution View:**  
- Focuses on runtime behavior and dynamic interactions.  
- **Components:** Processes or threads.  
- **Connectors:** Messages, data exchanges.  
- **Key Questions Answered:**  
  - How do components interact at runtime?  
  - What parts can run in parallel?  
  - How does data flow through the system?  

**Example:**  
A concurrency structure that identifies opportunities for parallel execution to enhance performance.

---

#### **C. Allocation View:**  
- Focuses on the relationship between software elements and their environment.  
- **Components:** Software modules, libraries, developers, hardware.  
- **Connectors:** Assignments (e.g., "assigned-to," "stored-in").  
- **Key Questions Answered:**  
  - How are elements mapped to hardware?  
  - What is the file structure during development?  
  - How are responsibilities assigned to development teams?  

**Example:**  
Mapping a database module to a specific server in a deployment scenario.

### **3. Beyond the Basics: Specialized Views**  
For complex systems, additional views may be necessary:  
1. **Data/Information View:** Focus on data structures and persistence (e.g., database design).  
2. **Physical View:** Describes hardware architecture, including servers and firewalls.  
3. **Security View:** Highlights security mechanisms and protocols.  

**Guidelines:**  
- Add a **physical view** for network-based systems.  
- Add a **security view** for high-security systems.  
- Add a **data view** for business-critical systems.

### **4. Tools for Representing Architecture Views**  
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly used to represent and document architectural views. UML provides both **structural** and **behavioral** diagrams:  

#### **Structural Diagrams:**
- **Class Diagram:** Shows classes and their relationships.  
- **Component Diagram:** Depicts components and their interfaces.  
- **Package Diagram:** Groups elements logically.  
- **Deployment Diagram:** Maps software to hardware.  

#### **Behavioral Diagrams:**
- **Sequence Diagram:** Visualizes interactions over time.  
- **State Machine Diagram:** Depicts state transitions.  
- **Activity Diagram:** Defines workflows and processes.

### **5. Examples of Good Architectural Practices**
1. Separate data-producing modules from data-consuming modules.  
2. Ensure processes/tasks can be easily reassigned to different processors.  
3. Use simple, consistent interaction patterns.

### **6. Real-World Application: Sales Order Business Process**  
Letâ€™s consider the sales order process as an example:  

#### **Conceptual View:**  
- Modules: Order Management, Shipping, Payment.  
- Connectors: Interfaces for communication between modules.  

#### **Execution View:**  
- Components: Order processing threads, shipping processes.  
- Connectors: Messages exchanged between processes.  

#### **Allocation View:**  
- Work Assignment: Developers assigned to modules.  
- Deployment: Modules distributed across servers.

### **Interactive Questions**
1. **Why might an execution view be more critical for a real-time system than a conceptual view?**  
2. **What would be the focus of an allocation view for a distributed cloud-based system?**  
3. **How do UML diagrams help stakeholders understand architecture?**  
4. **Which additional view would you prioritize for a high-security online banking system? Why?**
